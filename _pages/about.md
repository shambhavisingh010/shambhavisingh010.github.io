**Hi, I am Dr. Shambhavi Singh!** 🎓📊📈

<img align="right" src="/images/buddha.jpg" width="150" style="margin-right: 15px;">

Born and brought up in Bihar, a land that is steeped in knowledge. With the world’s first democracy in **Vaishali** and one of the oldest universities in **Nalanda**, be it Sita’s simplicity, Chanakya’s cleverness, Buddha's balance– this place is what rhythmed my reasoning.

Trained in the sacred soil of **Varanasi**, where Maa Ganga flows and Lord Shiva resides, I found my balance between temples and theorems - strolling through the ghats of Varanasi and the streets of **Banaras Hindu University**.

My journey with Bayes began with fear and uncertainty, but led to faith and understanding for this school of thought when I defended my PhD thesis in June of 2025. 

When I'm not buried decoding posteriors or, doing computations, you'll most likely find me:
- 📖 Lost in novels - contemporary or classic, English or Hindi
- 🎶 Vibing old-school melodies of Rafi and Kishore, and new-age beats of KK and Arijit.

🌏 Travelling is something that still is an unfulfilled wish, but then I read somewhere that the world is a living dataset and I intend to explore it, city by city, story by story.

✨ Whether you speak Statistics or, Stories, Let's connect! I would love to hear from you. 💌

PS - I have to thank **Dr. Ross Geller** 🦖🧕 for making being nerdy this cool!
