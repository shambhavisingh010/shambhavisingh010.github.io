**Hi, I am Dr. Shambhavi Singh.** 

Born and brought up in Bihar, a land that is steeped in knowledge. With the world’s first democracy in **Vaishali** and one of the oldest universities in **Nalanda**, be it Sita’s simplicity or Chanakya’s wisdom – this place is what rhythms my reasoning.

Trained in the sacred soil of **Varanasi**, where Maa Ganga flows and Lord Shiva resides, I found my balance between temples and theorems - strolling through the ghats of Varanasi and the streets of **Banaras Hindu University**.

My journey with Bayes began with fear and uncertainty, but led to faith and understanding for this school of thought when I defended my PhD thesis in June of 2025.
