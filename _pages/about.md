**Hi, I am Dr. Shambhavi Singh!** 🎓📊📈

  Born and brought up in Bihar — a land steeped in knowledge. With the world’s first democracy in <strong>Vaishali</strong> and one of the oldest universities in <strong>Nalanda</strong>, be it Sita’s simplicity, Chanakya’s cleverness, or Buddha's balance — this place is what rhythmed my reasoning.

  Trained in the sacred soil of <strong>Varanasi</strong>, where Maa Ganga flows and Lord Shiva resides, I found my balance between temples and theorems — strolling through the ghats of Varanasi and the streets of <strong>Banaras Hindu University</strong>.

  My journey with Bayes began with fear and uncertainty, but led to faith and understanding for this school of thought when I defended my PhD thesis in <strong>June 2025</strong>.

When I'm not buried decoding posteriors or, doing computations, you'll most likely find me:
- 📖 Lost in novels - contemporary or classic, English or Hindi
- 🎶 Vibing old-school melodies of Rafi and Kishore, and new-age beats of KK and Arijit.

🌏 Travelling is something that still is an unfulfilled wish, but then I read somewhere that the world is a living dataset and I intend to explore it, city by city, story by story.

✨ Whether you speak Statistics or, Stories, Let's connect! I would love to hear from you. 💌

PS - I have to thank **Dr. Ross Geller** 🦖🧕 for making being nerdy this cool!
