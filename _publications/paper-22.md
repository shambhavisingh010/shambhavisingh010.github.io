  Once a fertility model said â€” "We need to talk!"  
  "What happened?" â€” I asked.  
  "This assumption about independence of my parameters, it's not working anymore," it replied.  
  And the study started, with the help of Gaussian copula and MCMC methods.

<strong>Abstract.</strong><br>
The paper provides the Bayes analysis of the Hadwiger fertility model using the Gaussian copula prior to quantifying the information available in terms of marginal probability into a comprehensive joint probability framework for the parameters of the considered Hadwiger model. The resulting posterior, being analytically intractable, is analyzed using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, in particular, the Metropolis algorithm. The findings are supported by a real data example of reported age-specific fertility rate data. The approach is useful in the sense that it allows for an apt representation and analysis of the relationship between the priors.
