excerpt: 'In several countries the ASFR curves aren't smooth anymore. Instead they have humps in the early ages of childbearing. These distortions are obviously a reflection of societal shifts like early age births for few and delayed motherhood for others at the same time.   With 3 competing models on the table — Weibull-Weibull, Weibull-Normal, and Generalized Gamma-Normal—the Bayesian toolkit comes to the rescue.   Conclusion -The answer to distortions lies not in complexity, but in some clever combinations!!'
